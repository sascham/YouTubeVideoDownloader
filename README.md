# YouTube Video Downloader

This script downloads videos from a list of YouTube video URLs in a file named `video_urls.txt`. The script uses the **yt_dlp** library to download the videos and convert them to MP4 format with H.264 video and AAC audio codecs.

## Installation

To run this script, you need to have **Python 3** installed on your system. You can download Python 3 from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

You also need to install the **yt_dlp** library, which is a fork of the popular **youtube-dl** library with improved features and bug fixes. You can install **yt_dlp** using **pip**, the Python package installer, by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
pip install yt-dlp
```

## Usage

To use this script, you need to create a file named `video_urls.txt` in the same directory as the script. In this file, you can list the URLs of the YouTube videos you want to download, one URL per line.

Once you have created the `video_urls.txt` file and installed the **yt_dlp** library, you can run the script by opening a terminal or command prompt in the directory where the script and the `video_urls.txt` file are located, and running the following command:

```
python youtube_downloader.py
```

This will start the script, which will download each video in the `video_urls.txt` file and save it to a folder named `downloads` in the same directory as the script.

**Note** that the script downloads videos that are age-restricted and may require a YouTube account to access. If you have trouble downloading a video, make sure you are logged in to YouTube and have access to the video. Also, be aware of the legal and ethical considerations of downloading YouTube videos and respect the copyright and intellectual property rights of the content creators.
